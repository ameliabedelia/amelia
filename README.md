# amelia

### personal R package
featuring my go to color palettes, ggplot2 theme elements, geospatial data of Germany, and a few other misc R functions.

package was never intended for use by anyone other than me, so the documentation is patchy at best. however, if you wish to downlaod it, you may do so using:
```
devtools::install_github("ameliabedelia/amelia")
```
