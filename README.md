# amelia

### personal R package
featuring my go-to ggplot2 theme elements, color palettes for work, geospatial data of Germany, and a few other misc R functions.

package was never intended for use by anyone other than me, so the documentation is patchy at best. however, if you wish to download it, you may do so using:
```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ameliabedelia/amelia")
```
