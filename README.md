# amelia

### personal R package
featuring my go to color palettes, ggplot2 theme(s), and a few other misc functions.

package was never intended for use by anyone other than me, so the documentation is patchy at best. however, if you wish to downlaod it, you may do so using:
```
devtools::install_github("ameliabedelia/amelia")
```
